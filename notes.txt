Omerta is a platform for ephemeral compute swarms which allows providers to share their compute without worrying about what is being run. It does this by deleting VMs after use and requiring all networking traffic go through a VPN served by the compute consumer. This decreases risks of providing compute in a swarm without requiring heavyweight mechanisms for encrypted computation or identity attestation. This will hopefully allow wider access to compute swarms both for providers and consumers and subsequently decrease underutilization of our global compute resources.

While there are still legitimate security concerns like VM escapes and malicious providers. We argue that a coming requirement for a more proactive approach to computer security as well as the erosion of intellectual property rights as a result of machine intelligence will tip the scales firmly in our favor. Membership in an Omerta network provides, in addition to potential monetary compensation, a shephard for that user's compute resources which can keep the newly born wolves at bay.

- starts a new VM for every compute request which gets deleted when its done
- routes all traffic through VPN served by requester
- allows filtering and prioritizing sources of requests
- allows requiring requests include a description of their activity which you can log
- always monitors for rogue internet connections
- option to aggressively prioritize user tasks over other work
- support for checkpoint and restart of VMs

TODOs
CORE
- consolidate local storage all to one place instead of using .config/OmertaMesh directory
- make sure vms get released when either consumer or producer omertad is killed 
- make sure you can run omerta with sudo even while omertad is running as user and root has not used omerta
- debug messy peer lists, messy peer endpoint lists which include localhost, leaking of endpoints between networks during pings
- test stun server and NAT hole punching functionality, make sure LAN connections work
- get usermode consumer working on linux and mac
- separate out OmertaMesh into its own repo and establish API
- implement multi-interface support for control plane
- add support for simple messaging through OmertaMesh
- add support for prioritizing VM requests by network
- test relay mode for control and data planes in OmertaMesh, implement multicast
- implement compute capability and utilization monitoring
- implement mac gui
  - measure and limit VM energy consumption, use lower power CPU states where useful
  - automatically disable sleep while plugged in
  - automate killing or migration of VMs when user is at keyboard
- review code
- implement and test wireguard connection migration

COMPUTE ECONOMY
- review omc PDFs
- write up double spending as a mechanism for trading trust for coins

NETWORK BOOTSTRAPPING
- add a demo mode to omertad that only allows short small VM leases to guarantee availability 
- implement SSO and identity management
- add user warnings about threat model to onboarding with links to more detailed documentation
- add statistics tracking and querying support to mesh nodes, provide link to explain what is done with data and corresponding dashboards, attack and mitigation demos
- create app and standalone device with bootstrapping/disaster recovery mode that onboards people through a captive portal on an open SSID

VPN and MESH HARDENING
- write macos, ios, and linux VPN client and linux server apps that share network with omertad
  - add paranoid mode to OmertaMesh that requires all traffic go through wireguard to a home server as the exit point
- add multi-radio support and connection prioritization
  - add support for traffic shaping and bandwidth splitting
  - add support for a lora iPhone case

MACHINE ASSISTED MONITORING
- add support for explicitly exposing access to guest from host so isolation can't be assumed
- add a feature or separate tool for LLM assisted spot checking of shared compute and credit assignment
  - possibly use a blockchain for maintaining history as well as assigning coins based on contributions
- have option for more detailed machine intelligence assisted observation of VM by host provider
  - allows creation of a mechanism for trust and ranking of users
  - allows maintenance of free networks for good causes as decided by the provider
  - might need to be run and maintain by dedicated, more tech-savy participants who understand false positives

Automated review prompt
The automated reviewer should asking the following questions: How is this work novel compared to previous work in
  the field or similar fields? What are the weakest contributions, and what makes them so weak? What additional simulation work should be done to make this work more relevant and robust? What
  citations are missing, and how do they factor into the key points and simulation results? What logical jumps are there in the paper that make up the weakest links in the chain, and how can they
  be strengthened? What existing work is not receiving the credit it is due, and how is that bias influencing the writing or results? What are the methodological flaws in the simulations, missing
  parameters or unrealistic assumptions, and how should they be addressed? How are the mathematical models lacking in rigor, and what should be done to improve them in general or in relation to
  previous work? What kind of mathematical proofs or assertions that are otherwise provable in simulation or with empirical data are missing that would strengthen the work or hurt the key points?
  What empirical data contradicts the key points of the work and how are those contradictions addressed? 

  What ideas in the paper are not completely clear? What sections or sentences seem overly verbose relative to the points they are getting across and value to the paper? What content is being repeated that shouldn't be and what points aren't being repeated that deserve more emphasis? What structural changes could improve readability and the probability of readers continuing to read after they start? Do the sections and subsections properly flow into each other in a way that is not too abrupt? What hooks or punchy lines would best get your main points across and where should you add them? What figures or tables could be addded that would be most valuable for demonstrating the core ideas of the paper?

Please save the reviews somewhere in case we want to revisit them. Respond to the reviews with a separate review response file before making changes directly to the text. While addressing the reviews, if there are any changes or decisions you aren't completely sure about, please include those concerns in the review response so I can review those with you later. While creating your response, please fetch all works referenced, verify the reviewers claims, and ask the same questsions asked of the reviewer to yourself. 

Increase thoroughness of literature and related work search. Please present the questions in a way where the reviewer does not know what reviews have already taken place.

Walk citation graphs for most relevant works in reviews and in base work. Use Google Scholar for walking citations.

If you can't find the PDF of a work online, remove it from the citations. Add it to an appendix of works that you think should be cited but you don't have access to. Add a bit of detail on what impact it would have on the work. See if you can find another format of the work, reporting on the work, or derivative work to replace the paper that is open instead.
