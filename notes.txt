Omerta is a platform for ephemeral compute swarms which allows providers to share their compute without worrying about what is being run. It does this by deleting VMs after use and requiring all networking traffic go through a VPN served by the compute consumer. This decreases risks of providing compute in a swarm without requiring heavyweight mechanisms for encrypted computation or identity attestation. This will hopefully allow wider access to compute swarms both for providers and consumers and subsequently decrease underutilization of our global compute resources.

While there are still legitimate security concerns like VM escapes and malicious providers. We argue that a coming requirement for a more proactive approach to computer security as well as the erosion of intellectual property rights as a result of machine intelligence will tip the scales firmly in our favor. Membership in an Omerta network provides, in addition to potential monetary compensation, a shephard for that user's compute resources which can keep the newly born wolves at bay.

- starts a new VM for every compute request which gets deleted when its done
- routes all traffic through VPN served by requester
- allows filtering and prioritizing sources of requests
- allows requiring requests include a description of their activity which you can log
- always monitors for rogue internet connections
- option to aggressively prioritize user tasks over other work
- support for checkpoint and restart of VMs

Automated review prompt
The automated reviewer should asking the following questions: How is this work novel compared to previous work in
  the field or similar fields? What are the weakest contributions, and what makes them so weak? What additional simulation work should be done to make this work more relevant and robust? What
  citations are missing, and how do they factor into the key points and simulation results? What logical jumps are there in the paper that make up the weakest links in the chain, and how can they
  be strengthened? What existing work is not receiving the credit it is due, and how is that bias influencing the writing or results? What are the methodological flaws in the simulations, missing
  parameters or unrealistic assumptions, and how should they be addressed? How are the mathematical models lacking in rigor, and what should be done to improve them in general or in relation to
  previous work? What kind of mathematical proofs or assertions that are otherwise provable in simulation or with empirical data are missing that would strengthen the work or hurt the key points?
  What empirical data contradicts the key points of the work and how are those contradictions addressed? 

  What ideas in the paper are not completely clear? What sections or sentences seem overly verbose relative to the points they are getting across and value to the paper? What content is being repeated that shouldn't be and what points aren't being repeated that deserve more emphasis? What structural changes could improve readability and the probability of readers continuing to read after they start? Do the sections and subsections properly flow into each other in a way that is not too abrupt? What hooks or punchy lines would best get your main points across and where should you add them? What figures or tables could be addded that would be most valuable for demonstrating the core ideas of the paper?

Please save the reviews somewhere in case we want to revisit them. Respond to the reviews with a separate review response file before making changes directly to the text. While addressing the reviews, if there are any changes or decisions you aren't completely sure about, please include those concerns in the review response so I can review those with you later. While creating your response, please fetch all works referenced, verify the reviewers claims, and ask the same questsions asked of the reviewer to yourself. 

Increase thoroughness of literature and related work search. Please present the questions in a way where the reviewer does not know what reviews have already taken place.

Walk citation graphs for most relevant works in reviews and in base work. Use Google Scholar for walking citations.

If you can't find the PDF of a work online, remove it from the citations. Add it to an appendix of works that you think should be cited but you don't have access to. Add a bit of detail on what impact it would have on the work. See if you can find another format of the work, reporting on the work, or derivative work to replace the paper that is open instead.


I was just thinking about the protocol for updating the oldest date a peer existed in the network. There would be some scenario where someone told you that they or someone else was older than you thought. Then you would have to ask around. There are a couple avenues for misconduct in that sequence. One is that the peer lied about their age. The other is that a peer is ignoring too many requests for help with verfiication. In both cases, you need some formalized process of generating an accusation and a formalized trial process that checks which claim is more consistent with the network state. This is a more general description of what we are already doing with compute verification failures. The failure can be thought of separately. Instead of a cabal taking a vote, it is a cabal watching passively and stewarding the transaction. In the case of a failed check, an accusation is triggered and then a subsequent trial which may or may not include only cabal members. 


Protocol for recording VM rentals on chain is
- consumer makes request
- provider agrees and starts gathering witnesses
- once witnesses are gathered, local trust levels of consumer and provider relative to each other are verified
- witnesses compute burn rate for payment
- initial deposit from consumer is made to virtual escrow
- provider allocates VM
- provider tells witnesses when VM is allocated and connected to consumer and witness wireguards
- witnesses verify the VM connection, are able to vote to end transaction and return deposit here
- provider is allowed to accuse consumer of misuse and call for trial where others observe connection to consumer from inside VM, i.e., ssh over wireguard
- further use beyond what is secured by the deposit must be paid for in advance by securing more payment with witnesses, otherwise provider kills the VM
- provider tells witnesses when VM was cancelled which may have been done by either party or by a fault
- witnesses return any unused funds to consumer and deliver payment to provider
