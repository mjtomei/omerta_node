Omerta is a platform for ephemeral compute swarms which allows providers to share their compute without worrying about what is being run. It does this by deleting VMs after use and requiring all networking traffic go through a VPN served by the compute consumer. This decreases risks of providing compute in a swarm without requiring heavyweight mechanisms for encrypted computation or identity attestation. This will hopefully allow wider access to compute swarms both for providers and consumers and subsequently decrease underutilization of our global compute resources.

While there are still legitimate security concerns like VM escapes and malicious providers. We argue that a coming requirement for a more proactive approach to computer security as well as the erosion of intellectual property rights as a result of machine intelligence will tip the scales firmly in our favor. Membership in an Omerta network provides, in addition to potential monetary compensation, a shephard for that user's compute resources which can keep the newly born wolves at bay.

- starts a new VM for every compute request which gets deleted when its done
- routes all traffic through VPN served by requester
- allows filtering and prioritizing sources of requests
- allows requiring requests include a description of their activity which you can log
- always monitors for rogue internet connections
- option to aggressively prioritize user tasks over other work
- support for checkpoint and restart of VMs

TODOs
- automatically cleanup during startup, change name of cleanup command
- quality of life improvements
  - measure and limit VM energy consumption, use lower power CPU states where useful
  - automatically disable sleep while plugged in
  - automate killing or migration of VMs when user is at keyboard
- replace CLI tools (wg-quick, ip, iptables) with native APIs for production:
  - Linux: use netlink API for interfaces/routing, WireGuard netlink for VPN config, nftables for NAT
  - macOS: use NetworkExtension framework for VPN, pf for NAT
  - eliminates sudo requirements, more robust than shelling out
  - all implementations still use WireGuard protocol, full cross-platform interoperability
- set up provisioning provile for the network extension entitlement, get primary network extension approval flow working
- plan requirements for minimal initial release with support for auto-updates
- add support for prioritizing different networks
- add support for explicitly exposing access to guest from host so isolation can't be assumed
- look into mechanisms for protected VMs
- add a feature or separate tool for LLM assisted spot checking of shared compute and credit assignment
  - possibly use a blockchain for maintaining history as well as assigning coins based on contributions
- have option for more detailed machine intelligence assisted observation of VM by host provider
  - allows creation of a mechanism for trust and ranking of users
  - allows maintenance of free networks for good causes as decided by the provider
  - might need to be run and maintain by dedicated, more tech-savy participants who understand false positives
